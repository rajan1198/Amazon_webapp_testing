# Testing Amazon Web Application Using Hybrid Framework with Selenium, Java, Maven, and TestNG
To test the Amazon web application efficiently, I will implement a Hybrid Automation Framework using Selenium WebDriver, Java, Maven, and TestNG. This framework will integrate multiple testing methodologies, including Data-Driven, Keyword-Driven, and Modular Testing.

# 1. Framework Components
Selenium WebDriver: Automates browser interactions.
Java: Programming language for writing test scripts.
TestNG: Manages test execution, assertions, and reporting.
Maven: Manages dependencies and project structure.
Page Object Model (POM): Enhances test script maintainability.
Excel (Apache POI): Fetches test data dynamically.
Log4j: Captures logs for debugging.
Extent Reports: Generates test execution reports.

# 2. Execution Strategy
Use TestNG for test case prioritization and parallel execution.
Implement Assertions for validation.

# 3. Reporting & Logging
Generate Extent Reports for visual test execution analysis.
Implement Log4j for better debugging and failure analysis.
Capture screenshots of test failures using TakesScreenshot

This hybrid framework ensures scalability, maintainability, and efficiency, making it ideal for automating Amazonâ€™s web application testing.
